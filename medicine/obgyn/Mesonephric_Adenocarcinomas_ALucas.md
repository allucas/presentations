# Overview

- **Study**: Multi-institutional study on mesonephric adenocarcinomas (MA) and mesonephric-like adenocarcinomas (MLA) in the female reproductive system.

- **Tumor Types**: Cervix, endometrium, ovary.

- **Total Cases**: 99 (30 MA cervix, 44 MLA endometrium, 25 MLA ovary).

- **Conclusion**: Tumors are rare, aggressive, and difficult to diagnose due to diverse architectural patterns.

### 1. Advanced Stage Presentation

- **Diagnosis at FIGO Stages II-IV**:
  
  - Cervical MA: 60%
  
  - Endometrial MLA: 58%
  
  - Ovarian MLA: 39%
  
### 2. Frequent Recurrences

- **Recurrence Rates**: 52% of cases with distant metastasis.

- **Common Site**: Lung metastasis:

  - MA recurrences: 75%
  
  - MLA recurrences: 92%

### 3. Prognosis
- **5-year Disease-Specific Survival (DSS)**:

  - Cervical MA: 74%
  
  - Endometrial MLA: 72%
  
  - Ovarian MLA: 71%

### 4. Diagnostic Challenges
- **Tumor Architecture**: Tubular, papillary, solid, retiform patterns.

- **Immunohistochemistry**: GATA3, TTF1.

- **Molecular Alterations**: KRAS, NRAS mutations.

- **Misdiagnosis**: Occurred in:

  - Cervical MA: 10%
  
  - Endometrial MLA: 32%

### 5. Lung Recurrences

- **Frequent Lung Metastasis**: Unique to MA/MLA compared to common gynecologic cancers.


### 6. Molecular Findings

- **KRAS Mutations**: Common in MA and MLA.
  
- **Additional Mutations in MLA**: PIK3CA, ARID1A.
  
- **Overlap**: Molecular profile similarities with endometrioid adenocarcinomas.

### Histopathologic and Molecular Differentiation

- **Diagnosis**: Accurate differentiation is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.

- **Aggressiveness**: MLAs are more aggressive than mimics like low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas.

### Prognosis and Treatment

- **Survival Despite Recurrence**: With proper treatment, patients can achieve extended survival.

- **Pulmonary Metastasis**: Treatment should consider lung recurrence patterns.

# Conclusion

- **Rare but Aggressive**: MA and MLA require specialized diagnostic methods.

- **Survival**: Despite challenges, prolonged survival is possible with correct diagnosis and management.
