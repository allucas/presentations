## What the Disease Is

- **Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD)**: A group of pregnancy-related tumors originating from abnormal fertilization, affecting the placenta. GTD includes benign and malignant conditions, with malignant forms collectively referred to as **gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN)**. 

- **Hydatidiform Moles (HM)**: A common form of GTD, characterized by abnormal trophoblastic proliferation, divided into **complete (CM)** and **partial moles (PM)**. They are benign but have the potential to progress to malignant GTN.

---

## Epidemiology

- **Global Incidence**: GTD incidence varies globally, with rates of 1–2 per 1,000 pregnancies in North America and Europe, and 2–3 times higher in some Asian countries, Brazil, and India.

- **Risk Factors**: Major risk factors for molar pregnancy include extremes of maternal age (<15 or >45 years), with women over 45 having a 5–10 times higher risk. Previous molar pregnancies also increase the risk of recurrence (1-2% after the first, 15-20% after two).

## Classification

- **Hydatidiform Moles (Benign)**:

  - **Complete Mole (CM)**: Chromosomally paternal in origin, often 46, XX or 46, XY, with no fetal development. Presents with diffuse trophoblastic hyperplasia.

  - **Partial Mole (PM)**: Usually triploid (69, XXX or XXY), with evidence of abnormal fetal development.
  
- **Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (Malignant)**:
  - Includes **invasive mole**, **choriocarcinoma**, **placental-site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT)**, and **epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT)**, all of which have the potential for local invasion and metastasis.

## Diagnosis

<div style="width: 60%; float: left;">
- **Initial Symptoms**: Abnormal uterine bleeding in the first trimester is the most common presenting symptom of hydatidiform moles. Additional signs may include uterine enlargement, absence of fetal heart tones, and abnormally high hCG levels.

- **Ultrasound and hCG**: Diagnosis typically involves ultrasound imaging, revealing a "snowstorm" or "cluster of grapes" appearance, and elevated hCG levels. Ultrasound and hCG assays are crucial for early detection.

## Management

- **Primary Treatment**: 

  - **Suction Dilation & Curettage (D&E)** is the standard initial treatment for both complete and partial moles, especially for fertility preservation.

  - **Hysterectomy** may be considered for older patients (>40 years) or those who do not wish to preserve fertility, as it reduces the risk of GTN.

- **Chemotherapy**: In high-risk cases, chemotherapy (typically methotrexate or dactinomycin) may be required, particularly if post-molar GTN develops.

---

## Surveillance

- **hCG Monitoring**: Post-evacuation hCG monitoring is essential to detect the development of **post-molar GTN**. 

  - For **complete moles**, hCG should be monitored weekly until normalization and then monthly for 6 months.

  - For **partial moles**, follow-up ends after hCG normalization and one confirmatory test.

## Clinical Relevance

<div class="columns">
<div style="width: 50%; float: left;">
- **Early Detection and Treatment**: Early diagnosis through ultrasound and hCG assays has improved outcomes, significantly reducing complications. Treatment is highly effective, and most patients can retain fertility after successful management.
</div>
<div style="width: 50%; float: right;">
- **Risk of Progression to GTN**: Complete and partial moles carry a risk of progression to malignant GTN, particularly in high-risk groups. **Complete moles** are more likely than partial moles to progress to GTN, making vigilant post-treatment hCG monitoring critical.

## Significance of Hydatidiform Moles for GTN

- **Complete Hydatidiform Moles** have a higher risk (15-20%) of progressing to GTN, particularly invasive mole or choriocarcinoma, which can metastasize.

- **Partial Hydatidiform Moles** carry a lower risk (4%) of progression to GTN but still require careful follow-up to ensure remission.
